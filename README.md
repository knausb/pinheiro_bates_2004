# Model formulae in R

Critical to successfully implementing a model in R is understanding the syntax used to express the model.
I have fond this information a bit difficult to assemble, so I'll try here.
As [this post points out](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16313110), the cannonical reference is

Chambers J.M., and Hastie T.J., eds. (1992), Statistical Models in S. Chapman & Hall, London

which extends

Wilkinson G.N., and Rogers C.E. (1973). "Symbolic Description of Factorial Models for Analysis of Variance." Applied Statistics, 22, 392â€“399.

You may not have these references available at your fingertips.
References I like include [this pdf](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/richard.hahn/teaching/formulanotation.pdf) posted by Richard Hahn as well as [this post](https://science.nature.nps.gov/im/datamgmt/statistics/r/formulas/) by the US National Park Service.
